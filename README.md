# PyFibre Analysis Scripts

This repository contains useful tools for analysing databases produced from PyFibre analysis.

To begin, install the small Python `pyfibre_analysis_tools` package using `pip`:

    pip install -e .
    
Then copy a Jupyter notebook from the `python_analysis_scripts/notebooks/` directory that matches the image
type that was used for the analysis to the location of your data files:

    cp notebooks/<file-name>.ipynb <data-dir>

Edit the notebook as required and run the analysis.
